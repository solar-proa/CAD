# Solar proa CAD models

## About

The solar proa is a novel boat design for carbon-neutral
small-scale tropical maritime transport and exploration.
These boats combine traditional Southeast Asian and Polynesian
boat designs and rigs with solar power and modern materials.
More on solar proas is available at the website
[https://solarproa.org](https://solarproa.org)
generated by this repo.

## How this repo works

The boat models specified in this repo are available at
[https://solarproa.org](https://solarproa.org). Changes in the boat
specs here are automatically reflected in the website.

The boat models are programmed in Python.
All components are specified in software, in `src` as the
_single source of truth_. Features include:
- Main macro: The boats is generated by the macro `src/SolarProa.FCMacro` which also generates statistics and a view.
- Parameters: The boat is fully parameterized; the files `src/boats/RP*.py` let you choose the numbers of solar panels and the size of all components.
- Configurations: Moving parts such as rig, sails, rudders etc can be configured in the files `src/configurations/*.py`, for example `CloseHaul.py`.
- Mirroring: Solar proas have a transversal symmetry axis. Most components are described in file `mirror.py` and automatically mirrored in the generated model.
- Rotation: Some parts such as the rigs and rudder can be rotated or moved (see file `rotation.py`) in the configuration files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

3. Start FreeCAD

4. Macro > Macros, then choose the file `src/SolarProa.FCMacro`

5. You should see `SolarProa_RP2_CloseHaul` in the FreeCAD view.

## Playing with the FreeCAD GUI

Change the boat specifications and rerun the macro:
- Change `src/boats/RP2.py` to play with the number of solar panels, length of the boat etc.
- Change `src/boats/CloseHaul.py` to play with the sail settings, rudder position etc.
- Add or change boat features by editing `src/central.py`, `src/mirror.py`, or `src/rotation.py`.

## Generating `FCStd` files from command line

[For this, you need to have a working `make` utility. Currently tested only on Mac; feel free to try this on Windows and let us know your results, using a PR or issue.]

To generate all files (all boat designs with all configurations) just type
```
make
```
Or to generate an individual `FCStd` file type
```
make build BOAT=RP2 CONFIG=CloseHaul
```
The generated files are placed in the folder `output`, for example:
```
output/SolarProa_RP2_CloseHaul.FCStd
```

## Under the hood

Crucial for the CICD approach to CAD using FreeCAD is:
- FreeCAD's [macros](https://wiki.freecad.org/Macros) feature
- the ability to run FreeCAD headless, using `freecadcmd` on Linux and using `--console` on Mac
- this [observation](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=857226#p857226) by FreeCAD user [`jcsahnwaldt`](https://forum.freecad.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=85580&sid=a9af5bd37412a3771f25378b4c027a2c) to use GUI features in headless FreeCAD with `PySide.QtGui`

Some design decisions:
- Toolchain automation with [`make`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)>) using this [Makefile](https://github.com/solar-proa/CAD/blob/main/Makefile)
- Website generation using [Jekyll](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)>)
- YAML statistics generated by headless FreeCAD
- Rendering by headless FreeCAD using `jcsahnwaldt`'s observation

## Further development

Let's explore what output formats and we can generate and what tools are available to get the most out of our FreeCAD designs. Any contributions are welcome.
