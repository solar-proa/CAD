# Roti Proa CAD model

## Features

The CAD model is entirely programmed in Python.
All components need to be specified in software, in `src`. Features include:
- Main macro: The boat is generated by the macro `src/RotiProa2.FCMacro` which also generates statistics and a view
- Parameters: The boat is fully parameterized; the file `parameters.py` lets you choose the numbers of solar panels and the size of all components
- Mirroring: Roti Proa has a transversal symmetry axis. Most components are described in file `mirror.py` and automatically mirrored in the main

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

3. Start FreeCAD

4. Macro > Macros, then choose the file `src/RotiProa.FCMacro`

5. You should see Roti Proa II in the FreeCAD view

## Playing with the FreeCAD GUI

- Play with `src/boats/RP2.py`: change parameters such as the number of solar panels, length of the boat, etc and rerun the macro to see the result.
- Play with `src/boats/CloseHaul.py`: change the sail settings and rerun the macro to see the result.

## Generating `FCStd` files from command line

To generate all files (all boat designs with all configurations) just type
```
make
```
Or to generate an individual `FCStd` file type
```
make build BOAT=RP2 CONFIG=CloseHaul
```
The generated files are placed in the folder `output`, for example:
```
output/RotiProa_RP2_CloseHaul.FCStd
```
