## Overview

**Status:** ✅ Completed and tested (December 2024 - June 2025)

Roti Proa I was our proof-of-concept prototype that validated the feasibility of combining traditional outrigger design with modern solar-electric propulsion in tropical waters. The 4.2-meter vessel successfully demonstrated the core principles that inform our larger commercial designs.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Sea trials validated** in Singapore waters near Changi
- **Top speed:** 6.5 knots (12 km/h) under electric power
- **Solar capacity:** 1 kW peak (2 panels)
- **Propulsion:** 2 kW electric outboard motor
- **Batteries:** 2 x 50 Ah, LiFePO₄
- **Sailing rig:** Dual independent sport rigs (Optimist) for experimental configuration

The prototype proved that solar proas are viable for tropical Southeast Asian waters and provided crucial data for scaling up to the 9-meter Roti Proa II design.

## Legacy & Impact

Roti Proa I's successful trials provided the confidence and empirical data needed to pursue commercial-scale development. The prototype demonstrated that:

✅ Solar-electric propulsion is viable in tropical waters  
✅ Traditional outrigger designs adapt well to modern electric systems  
✅ Shunting proas can effectively integrate solar panels  
✅ The combination creates a compelling eco-tourism experience

These insights directly informed the design of Roti Proa II and validate our approach for the 13-meter Roti Proa III.
