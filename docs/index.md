## At a glance

Project _Solar Proa_ is developing wind-solar-powered hybrid vessels for carbon-neutral small-scale tropical maritime transport, exploration, and tourism.
The completion of our 9-meter minimal viable product _Roti Proa II_ is targeted for mid-2026 and strategic partnerships are available for commercial validation.

## The vision

Electric vehicle adoption across Asia has created new expectations for quiet, clean transportation - expectations that extend to maritime sector. Project Solar Proa is bringing carbon-neutral propulsion to water transport, island-hopping, snorkeling, and diving tourism with vessels that combine:

- **Traditional Design** - Inspired by Austronesian outrigger proas and Indonesian sailing 
- **Modern Engineering** - Parametric CAD design, aluminum construction, and efficient electric propulsion
- **Renewable Energy** - on-board photovoltaic energy harvesting with 4kW solar arrays providing continuous zero-emission operation in combination with traditional sails

## Why Tropical Southeast Asia?

**Exceptional solar irradiation** makes the region ideally suited for sustainable maritime propulsion. Our designs optimize traditional outrigger configurations to maximize solar panel area while maintaining excellent sailing characteristics.

The shunting, single-outrigger layout provides:
- Ample space for solar arrays between hull and outrigger
- Sail positioning that avoids casting shadows on panels
- Superior stability and efficiency for safe hybrid propulsion

---

## Commercial Opportunities

**Eco-Tourism Applications:**
- Short-distance passenger transport
- Island-hopping and coastal exploration
- Snorkeling and diving expeditions  
- Educational sailing experiences
- Wildlife observation cruises

**Operational Advantages:**
- Zero fuel costs and carbon emissions
- Significantly lower maintenance than diesel
- Quiet operation enhancing wildlife experiences
- Regulatory advantages from green certifications

**Market Position:**
At 10 knots under motor power, Roti Proa II targets the contemplative pace of eco-tourism - where the journey itself is part of the value proposition.

---

## Technical Innovation

All vessel designs are created using **parametric CAD modeling in FreeCAD and Python**, enabling:

- Novel boat designs optimized for solar-wind-hybrid propulsion
- Continuous power and weather monitoring for accurate arrival time prediction
- Rapid design iteration and optimization, version control and design transparency
- Open-source accessibility for educational purposes
