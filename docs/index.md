</div>

## Executive Summary

Project Prahu Surya Layar is developing solar-electric hybrid vessels for carbon-neutral eco-tourism in tropical Southeast Asia, with a 9-meter MVP _Roti Proa II_ completing mid-2026 and strategic partnerships available for commercial validation.

---

## The Vision

Electric vehicle adoption across Asia has created new expectations for quiet, clean transportation - expectations that extend to recreational maritime experiences. We're bringing carbon-neutral propulsion to island-hopping, snorkeling, and diving tourism through vessels that combine:

- **Traditional Design** - Inspired by Austronesian outrigger proas and Indonesian sailing traditions
- **Modern Engineering** - Parametric CAD design, aluminum construction, efficient electric propulsion
- **Renewable Energy** - 4kW solar arrays plus sail propulsion for zero-emission operation

## Why Tropical Southeast Asia?

**Exceptional solar irradiation** makes the region ideally suited for sustainable maritime propulsion. Our designs optimize traditional outrigger configurations to maximize solar panel area while maintaining excellent sailing characteristics.

The shunting, single-outrigger layout provides:
- Ample space for solar arrays between hull and outrigger
- Crew positioning that avoids casting shadows on panels
- Superior stability and efficiency for electric propulsion

---

## Commercial Opportunity

**Eco-Tourism Applications:**
- Island-hopping and coastal exploration
- Snorkeling and diving expeditions  
- Educational sailing experiences
- Wildlife observation cruises

**Operational Advantages:**
- Zero fuel costs and carbon emissions
- Significantly lower maintenance than diesel
- Quiet operation enhancing wildlife experiences
- Regulatory advantages from green certifications

**Market Position:**
At 10 knots under motor power, Roti Proa II targets the contemplative pace of eco-tourism - where the journey itself is part of the value proposition.

---

## Technical Innovation

All vessel designs are created using **parametric CAD modeling in FreeCAD and Python**, enabling:

- Rapid design iteration and optimization
- Automated generation of construction documentation
- Version control and design transparency
- Open-source accessibility for educational purposes

## Current Status & Timeline

**Q1 2026:** Main hull delivery (9m Roti Proa II)  
**Q2 2026:** Final assembly and sea trials  
**Q3 2026:** Commercial validation with strategic partners  
**2027+:** Pilot production and 13m vessel development

---

## Partnership Opportunities

We welcome strategic partners for:

- **Field testing collaboration** and operational feedback
- **Joint development** of eco-tourism protocols
- **Co-branding opportunities** for sustainability leadership
- **CSR alignment** through maritime innovation support

Partnership structures can be flexibly tailored to organizational priorities.
